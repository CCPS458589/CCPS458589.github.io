<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>With over a decade of experience I specialize in earning the trust of teachers. As a student I've worked in many sectors ranging from Elementary to Middle School, even dipping my toes in High school all around the nation. Throughout my career I've been able to hold a strong grades, motivate the students around me, even doing the work for the people around me. At school I manage over 7 different class periods, with hundreds of assignments every month. My main goal is to further my experience to help the next company I work at, while further the academics of my school. 
In my current position I'm learning the basics of just about everything. Ranging from business development to world economics. I've been able to discover new learning strategies, while also discovering new memorization techniques. I enjoy learning about new and diverse cultures, already traveling around the world to learn from the great world around us. While I'm not learning something new or helping my company grow, I'm participating in running in cross country and debating both at the state level. I feel great enjoyment when it comes to working with groups especially when I'm able to contribute and make the team feel better.</p>
